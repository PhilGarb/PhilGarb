> Building for the modern web with JavaScript, CSS, ReactJS, GraphQl and NodeJS.

## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a freelance web-developer from GÃ¶ttingen Germany, building fast and modern web experiences. Originally I studied political science, but I discovered my passion for coding and problem solving along the way and made the switch. My background in social sciences makes me a better team player, since discussion and collaboration was central to my studies.

### Looking for support?

### What am I working on?

Currently my passion project is @open-decision a web-app and platform to allow professionals to digitize the repetitive part of their work. The project teaches me a lot about React, Typescript and GraphQl.
